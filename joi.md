## Joi

[Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi)

Validation of a js object is a requirement across the board, and *joi* seems to address this requirement without "forcing" an approach.

JSON into and from the server can be validated.

By the time the "application logic" receives or send  an object it is "clean".

What is the implication of this wrt **mongoose** ? Is the wrapper still required ? Perhaps we can add a simple wrapper to interface to Mongo ?
